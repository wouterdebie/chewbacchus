    <h2>Intergalactic Krew of Chewbacchus - 2024</h2>

    <h3>What is this thing?!</h3>
    <p>
      Congratulations! You have found the
      <a
        href="https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Vogon_poetry"
        target="_blank"
      >
        Vogon Poetry
      </a>
      Transceiver. This device listens to messages from other devices sending
      Vogon Poetry. At the same time, it sends poetry to other devices out
      there. And if it doesn't receive a poem for a while, it will show one
      anyway.
    </p>
    <h3>Who made this?</h3>
    <p>
      I, Wouter de Bie did. Don't hesitate to contact me at
      <a href="mailto:wouter@evenflow.nl">wouter@evenflow.nl</a>
    </p>
    <h3>How did you make this?</h3>
    <p>
      The devices uses an ESP32 micro controller (the thing on the left side
      with all the chips) and an SSD1306 OLED display (the display on the
      right).
    </p>
    <h3>The battery is dead, what do I do?</h3>
    <p>
      There is a micro USB port on the micro controller. Carefully remove the
      micro controller from the tin can. It's attached using double sided tape,
      but it might be stuck a bit. Plug it in a USB cable (like the one you use
      to charge your phone), set the switch on the front to ON and it will
      charge. A bright blue LED should light up. When the blue light starts to
      flicker, the battery should be charged.
    </p>
    <h3>
      I only see a sliver of the the Chewbacchus logo. Is the device dead?
    </h3>
    <p>
      It probably needs to be recharged. I didn't implement battery monitoring,
      but I've seen that the device will restart when the battery is too low
      when turning on the radios for wireless communication. Since the radios
      turn on after the display starts displaying the logo, it will show a part
      of the logo before resetting.
    </p>
    <h3>Can you share the code?</h3>
    <p>
      Sure!
